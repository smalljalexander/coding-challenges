//Complete the function that receives as input a string, and produces outputs according to the following table:

//Input	Output
//"Jabroni"	"Patron Tequila"
//"School Counselor"	"Anything with Alcohol"
//"Programmer"	"Hipster Craft Beer"
//"Bike Gang Member"	"Moonshine"
//"Politician"	"Your tax dollars"
//"Rapper"	"Cristal"
//anything else	"Beer"
//Note: anything else is the default case: if the input to the function is not any of the values in the table, then the return value should be "Beer".

//Make sure you cover the cases where certain words do not show up with correct capitalization. For example, the input "pOLitiCIaN" should still return "Your tax dollars".
